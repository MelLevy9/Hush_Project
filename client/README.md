This project was inspired by 'Reddit'.
Reddit is a website I really like and enjoy visiting.

This website is for people who want to write and share everything they can and want without being judged.
This is why in the sign up page we recommend using an anonymous username to get the full experience of this site. 

In this project everyone (even not users) can read posts, enter a group's page and search posts.
Users can do more in this site, they can create posts in any group they want and they can add a group to their favotites.
For the admin however there is much more control in this site. The admin can create a new group, delete a group, update a group,
create a new user, update and delete a user, and update and delete posts.

I hope that anyone that see this project will enjoy it as much as i enjoyed writing it.
